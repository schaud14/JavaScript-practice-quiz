Integer/Float Addition:
Adds two integers or two float numbers.

Integer/Float Subtraction:
Subtracts two intergers or two float numbers.

Complex Addition/Subtraction:
Add/Subtracts two complex numbers.
examples:
(1+0i)+(1+0i)=(2+0i)..it wont match (2) excluding the imaginary part. (but this has been implimented in extra credit part.)
similarly it wont match ans (0+5i) to (5i). (but this has been implimented in extra credit part.)

Extra Addition and Subtraction:
In this part the the ranndom no can have real or imaginary part as 0 or 1.

If ans is (0+0i) then the program can identify the correct ans (0+0i) as (0) also. both ans are correct in this module.
similarly (2+0i) is equal to (2+0i) or (2).
similarly (0+2i) is equal to (0+2i) or (2i).

The negative sign implememtation is also done.
(2+-1i) will be always represented as (2-1i).
